<h1 align="center">Educational Data Mining (EDM) </h1></br>


###Overview<br/>
Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emerging discipline dedicated to developing methods for exploring unique data derived from educational settings. The primary goal is to leverage computational approaches to better understand students and the learning environments they inhabit.

###Description<br/>
This repository focuses on the field of EDM, welcoming both basic and applied papers that detail mature work involving computational approaches in educational data mining. The content covers a range of high-quality, original work, including but not limited to the following topics:<br/>

Processes or Methodologies: <br/>
- Exploration of approaches used to analyze educational data.<br/>
- Integration with Pedagogical Theories: Discussing the fusion of data mining techniques with pedagogical theories.<br/>
- Utilizing Findings for Improvement: Describing how research findings contribute to enhancing educational software or supporting teachers.<br/>
- Enhancing Understanding of Learners' Domain Representations: Work aimed at improving comprehension of learners' domain representations.<br/>
- Improving Assessment of Learners' Engagement: Exploring methods to enhance the assessment of learners' engagement in various learning tasks.<br/>

###Project Topics<br/>
EDM 1: Stages of an MDE Project<br/>
EDM 2: Prediction of which students will pass, with data normalization using MinMaxScaler, results with Acuracy, Recall, F1, Precision<br/>
EDM 3:<br/> Including more metrics in EDM 2
EDM 4:<br/> Essentially, instead of predicting whether the student passed, the model should predict what the student's final grade will be. Additionally, there are some additional preprocessing steps that we will undertake.
EDM 5:<br/>
